# Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures Cwk3

In this course student reinforce both mathematical and practical knowledge of algorithms and data structures, including differences between theoretical and empirical analysis.

Learning Outcomes:
1. Explain both formally and informally the difference between "best", "expected", and "worst" case behaviour of an algorithm, and use asymptotic notation to analyse the time and space complexity of algorithms. Use recurrence relations to determine the time complexity of recursively defined algorithms.
2. Describe the properties, typical implementations, and example application use cases of abstract data types (e.g., stacks, queues, sets, dictionaries, priority queues) and discuss the costs and benefits of dynamic and static data structure implementations; use the above knowledge to justify the selection of appropriate data types in a range of settings.
3. Work with a range of data structures to implement basic algorithms given pseudocode or a task specification; perform empirical studies to compare the performance of different implementations of the same algorithm or data type on various input (or different algorithms for the same problem) and explain what can be learned from empirical analysis that cannot be learned from asymptotic analysis (and vice versa).
4. Describe various algorithmic strategies (e.g., brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, recursive backtracking, dynamic programming) and give examples of each from a range of application areas including language processing and information retrieval. Hand-simulate a range of algorithms, including algorithms for searching, sorting, hashing, solving graph problems, and examples of dynamic programming. Give example applications that would use each algorithm and choose appropriate algorithms to use for example problems.
5. Define informally the classes P and NP and give examples of problems in NP. Explain the halting problem and its significance.

For this project I was tasked with exploring and comparing the different heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem.
